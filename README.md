/rest/v1/calendar/init/ - GoogleCalendarInitView():
To begin,  you use the Google API Client Library for Node.js to initiate the OAuth flow and prompt the user to grant permission to access their Google Calendar. 
You can/should use the google-auth-library package to handle the OAuth flow and retrieve the access token. 

This implementation will redirect the user to the Google OAuth consent screen where they can grant permission to your application to access their Google Calendar.

Moving forward, /rest/v1/calendar/redirect/ -> GoogleCalendarRedirectView():
Once the user grants permission, they will be redirected to your redirect_uri with a code parameter that you can exchange for an access token.

This implementation will exchange the code parameter for an access token using the getToken() method of the oAuth2Client object. It will then set the access token on the oAuth2Client object and use it to fetch a list of the user's upcoming calendar events using the calendar.events.list() method of the google.calendar object.

Note: Make sure to replace your_client_id, your_client_secret, and your_redirect_url with the appropriate values from your Google Cloud Console
